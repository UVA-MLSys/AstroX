# AstroX

Project Description: 

Leveraging unsupervised and multimodal learning, we
aim to advance foundation models for a scalable and
better representation of large astronomy data for
insights. AstroX is a foundation model designed to
learn representations by aligning galaxy images and
spectra.This in-progress work focuses primarily on the
multimodal training phase, building upon and expanding
the capabilities of the state-of-the-art AstroCLIP model.
It paves the Way for Agentic AI and Autonomy in
Cosmology research for Astronomers.
